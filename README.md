# NEAT Self-Driving Car Project

This project is an implementation of a self-driving car using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) library in Python. NEAT is a method developed by Kenneth O. Stanley for evolving artificial neural networks with genetic algorithms. In this project, we utilize NEAT to evolve neural networks that control a simulated car to navigate a track autonomously.
Features

    Utilizes NEAT library for evolving neural networks
    Simulates a self-driving car navigating through a track
    Genetic algorithm-based training for neural network evolution
    Visualization of the evolving neural networks and car performance

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    NEAT Python library
    Pygame (for visualization)

# The Idea
The idea of this repository is to create an environment with a Racing Track, and have cars drive in it.

# Goals:
Use different AI approaches to make the cars race in the Tracks.

# Future ideas:
Have competitions among cars to see who created the best racing AI.
